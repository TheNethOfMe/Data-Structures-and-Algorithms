# Linked List

## Challenge

Create a class for nodes and a class for a linked list that will contain those node objects. I decided to make this fun and all of the nodes are breakfast cereals.

## How to Run

You can interact with this and add your own cereals to the linked list by running `dotnet run` from the linkedList directory. This also features a full test suite which can be run with the `dotnet test` command from the LinkedListTests directory.
