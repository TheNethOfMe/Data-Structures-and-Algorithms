# Fibonacci Sequence

This isn't a solution I came to on my own. I had a ton of help from [this site](https://www.dotnetperls.com/fibonacci). It's basically the same code, line for line, that makes it work since I had a heck of a time figuring out how to start it on my own.

I'm still not entirely sure how or why it makes sense for the Fibonacci sequence to start at 0, but who am I to argue with math nerds who are much smarter than I am? 

I really wanted a solution to the problem that didn't rely on hard-coding the return values for the 0 and 1 indexes. This code solves that problem by calculating the number to return and the next number in the sequence and saving them each iteration of the for loop.
