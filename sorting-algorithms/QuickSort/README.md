# Quick Sort

## About

This is another algorithm that sorts values in an array of integers from smallest to biggest. This algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach to sorting the input array. I decided to make the method only require the array to be sorted. From there, it passes in the neccessary data to the method that actually starts sorting the array. I also have a helper method that prints the array to the console.

## How to Run

You can run a short demo by running `dotnet run` from the QuickSort directory. No tests for this one. Sorry.
