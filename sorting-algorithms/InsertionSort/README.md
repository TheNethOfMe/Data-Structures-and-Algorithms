# Insertion Sort

## About

This is an algorithm that sorts values in an array of integers from smallest to biggest. This algorithm uses nested loops making the time complexity Big O(n^2). Because the array is changed in-place, the space complexity is Big O(1). This sort wouldn't be very efficient for a large array of numbers.

## How to Run

You can  run a short demo by running `dotnet run` from the InsertionSort directory. This also features a test that just runs the algorithm with the same test array from the demo. It can be run with the `dotnet test` command from the TestInsert directory.
