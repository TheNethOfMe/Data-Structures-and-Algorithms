# Merge Sort

## About

This is another algorithm that sorts values in an array of integers from smallest to biggest. This algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach to sorting the input array by creating smaller and smaller arrays until left with arrays with only one integer. After that, the integers are sorted and placed back into the original array in order.

## How to Run

You can run a short demo by running `dotnet run` from the MergeSort directory. No tests for this one. Sorry.
